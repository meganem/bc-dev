#Bloomcase Development

This repo is for tracking code development of Bloomcase, my MFA thesis work and future product.

##Milestones:

1. Create solid layout code for "tree/force" layout (what should it be called?), solving the outstanding issues in the queue. Ideally this is something we can contribute back to the d3 community.
2. Develop touch and mouse interactions allowing for touch-drag creation of new nodes, connecting and disconnecting nodes.
3. Integrate prototype code into Drupal installation located here: http://meganerinmillerdesign.com/bc-drpl/
4. Develop AJAX-driven forms into the Drupal instance to allow for real-time adding/removing/detaching nodes on the map.

##Branch Information
I have a lot of branches. Let me explain them:
* prototype-csv -- my original prototype, with data as CSV
* prototype-json -- where I developed the json version of the code to work with Drupal's json output
* drpl-1.0-alpha -- my Drupal theme, in which you will find the most up-to-date version of the code, as it is integrated into Drupal via the theme layer.
* jQueryMobile-1.0 -- my jQuery mobile prototype for a mobile web app, ideally for iPhone using Chrome or Safari. This is showing the map, as well as several screens such as login etc.
* 1.0-alpha -- this is where I want to develop the code to be released to the d3 community
* master -- just a placeholder for the repo with this readme
