#Bloomcase Development

This repo is for tracking code development of Bloomcase, my MFA thesis work and future product.

##Milestones:

1. Create solid layout code for "tree/force" layout (what should it be called?), solving the outstanding issues in the queue. Ideally this is something we can contribute back to the d3 community.
2. Develop touch and mouse interactions allowing for touch-drag creation of new nodes, connecting and disconnecting nodes.
3. Integrate prototype code into Drupal installation located here: http://meganerinmillerdesign.com/bc-drpl/
4. Develop AJAX-driven forms into the Drupal instance to allow for real-time adding/removing/detaching nodes on the map.
